# DIAGNOSIS-OF-LUNG-CANCER

roject Topic - Detection of Lung cancer Using Deep learning with Web application 

1. Data collection 
	Here we are using images of lung cancer images and normal images 
	The dataset is collected from the kaggle website. 

2. Data Pre processing 
	It a process of reducing the null values and noisy data. 

3. Model Implementation 
	Deep learning model 
		CNN 
4. Saving the trained model into model file (h5)

5. Applying the model file in the flask frame work. 

To run the web application 

1. Open anaconda prompt 

2. Copy the file location 

3. type in prompt cd paste the location here

4. Now type python clientApp.py 

5. Copy the link an d paste in chrome
